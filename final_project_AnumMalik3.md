## Part 1
Since the onset of October, family and friends back home in Pakistan have been very vocal about the deteriorating air quality. As a Pakistani citizen myself, I have been aware of and lived through the smog crisis that has come to the forefront in the past decade. A heavy thick layer of smoke and fog envelops my city of Lahore, which is now the third most polluted city in the world. It stings the eyes, reduces visibility, makes breathing unbearable and poses significant health risks for future populations. I had been following the Air Quality Index at [IQ Air](https://www.iqair.com/us/pakistan) and decided to choose this as my topic to tell the story. Since the W.H.O has announced air pollution as a global threat, I started my research from there and gathered data from different sources for both global and Pakistan specific metrics to build a story that outlined the imminent threat, its devastating impact on life expectancy, the causes and what individuals and policy makers alike can do to alleviate the damage. I was confident that my data was sufficient enough to convert my sketches to graphs on Flourish or Tableau.

## Part 2
My main task for Part 2 was to construct a storyboard that outlined the sketches converted to graphs using the collected data and to ensure that the story was told in a way that the identified audience could relate to with an appropriate call to action. At this point, since most of my research was done through a policy-maker perspective; I had not clearly identified any actions that individuals themselves could take to play their part in improving the air quality in Pakistan. This was one thing that was pinpointed by every individual in my user research group as an improvement for Part 3.

The target audience identified were the citizens of Pakistan focused in the urban centers of the country. To gather a representative sample I spoke to a female teacher, a male in the energy sector and a Pakistani student at Carnegie Mellon. This allowed me to gather feedback for not only points to add for the content but for design and layout decisions I had made.

## Part 3
### Final Deliverable 
I used the feedback from 'Part 2' to build a more holistic and aesthetically pleasing story in Shorthand. I edited the charts on Flourish, established a more coherent color scheme, added impactful imagery and aligned my story for a supporting analysis from various other sources. The link to the final story and relevant data is outlined below.

### Intended Audience
Even though the audience identified in Part 2 were the citizens of Pakistan, I wanted my story to be accessible for multiple audiences, especially individuals that could potentially want to learn more about something that has been deemed as a global threat --- were advocates for policy issues related to climate change--
