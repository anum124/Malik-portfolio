## Part 1
Since the onset of October, family and friends back home in Pakistan have been very vocal about the deteriorating air quality. As a Pakistani citizen myself, I have been aware of and lived through the smog crisis that has come to the forefront in the past decade. A heavy thick layer of smoke and fog envelops my city of Lahore, which is now the third most polluted city in the world. It stings the eyes, reduces visibility, makes breathing unbearable and poses significant health risks for future populations. I had been following the Air Quality Index at [IQ Air](https://www.iqair.com/us/pakistan) and decided to choose this as my topic to tell the story. Since the W.H.O has announced air pollution as a global threat, I started my research from there and gathered data from different sources for both global and Pakistan specific metrics to build a story that outlined the imminent threat, its devastating impact on life expectancy, the causes and what individuals and policy makers alike can do to alleviate the damage. I was confident that my data was sufficient enough to convert my sketches to graphs on Flourish or Tableau.

## Part 2
My main task for Part 2 was to construct a storyboard that outlined the sketches converted to graphs using the collected data and to ensure that the story was told in a way that the identified audience could relate to with an appropriate call to action. At this point, since most of my research was done through a policy-maker perspective; I had not clearly identified any actions that individuals themselves could take to play their part in improving the air quality in Pakistan. This was one thing that was pinpointed by every individual in my user research group as an improvement for Part 3.

The target audience identified were the citizens of Pakistan focused in the urban centers of the country. To gather a representative sample I spoke to a female teacher, a male in the energy sector and a Pakistani student at Carnegie Mellon. This allowed me to gather feedback for not only points to add for the content but for design and layout decisions I had made.

## Part 3
### Final Deliverable 
I used the feedback from 'Part 2' to build a more holistic and aesthetically pleasing story in Shorthand. I edited the charts on Flourish, established a more coherent color scheme, added impactful imagery and aligned my story for a supporting analysis from various other sources. The link to the final story and relevant data is outlined below.

Note: more data sources are outlined in the 'References' section in the Shorthand Link.

Let's go over detailed steps of the progression from Part 2 to 3 by describing the audience, the recommended changes, design process and the overall narrative on Shorthand. 

### Audience
Even though the audience identified in Part 2 were the citizens of Pakistan, I wanted my story to be relatable or accessible for multiple readers, especially individuals that could potentially want to learn more about something that has been deemed as a global threat. Furthermore, I wanted to ensure that the narrative would have enough detail to push advocates for policy issues related to climate change in a direction for change with meaningful statistics. Even though over the past decade, there has been an increase in installation of air quality monitoring tools and subsequent data collection across the regions of Pakistan, there has not been any significant policy shift to diminish the burden the people face on a daily basis. 

Since the topic was very specific, the majority of the content stayed as originally outlined in Part 1 and 2. However, to make it more inclusive to the general audience, I added an Infographic detail of the concept of Smog beyond its visual appearance of a mixture between fog and smoke - which is the prevalent definition in most of the earlier literature. Additionally. I reiterated the hazardous nature of the air in Pakistan through both textual content and visuals to reach a broader audience.  

### Feedback and Design Changes from Part 2
There were approximately 8 changes that were highlighted in Part 2 of the project by dissecting the user research. In the process of making the changes on Shorthand, I was successfully able to implement 7 out of 8 design and content changes onto my initial storyboard to it more impactful and complete besides including moreimpactful imagery from Prexels to move the audience and explain the extent of the difficulties faced.

#### Infographic on Canva: "Explain what smog is, how it contributes to air pollution and what time of the year it hits its peak in the introduction" 
To make it easier to understand for a more general audience, I included an infographic labelled "How is Smog Formed‚Äù that I made in Canva by drawing inspiration from the [Al-Jazeera Article](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/9/satellite-image-shows-smog-in-india-and-pakistan#:~:text=How%20is%20smog%20formed%3F,to%20warm%20air%20in%20atmosphere). This section introduced the components of Smog, the prevalent terminology and the context within which it is used. The section also hints on the movement of air quality in high income countries and how it was curtailed despite the onset of industrialization due to more effective policy-making. However, it warns the audience of the minute change in the loss of years of life expectancy regardless of this improvement. The introduction then describes the situation in Pakistan for a smooth transition towards the topic at hand. 

#### "Use the introductory data that compares Pakistan's PM 2.5 level to the W.H.O standards as a highlighted section for a standout statistic"
I had previously written the statistics comparing 53.6 micrograms per cubic meter of hazardous PM 2.5 in Pakistan to the W.H.O standard of 10 micrograms per cubic meter as a text box below the world map. One of the individuals interviewed in my user research rightfully stated that a powerful metric such as this needs to have its own highlighted section. In order to create this on Shorthand, I found an image on Prexel of a man wearing a mask which was impactful and created section in a bigger bolder text. To distinguish the numbers, i highlighted the hazardous number 53.6 in 'red' and the safety standard 10 in 'green'. 

#### "Do not use 'Pakistan is the Fourth Most Polluted Country in the World' as a title for the world map"
The teaching assistant shared a useful feedback regarding the world map in my story. Initially, the title was meant to focus more on the darker regions and I had mistakenly assumed that the reader would be able to identify Pakistan from the top 5. To make the flow clearer, I changed the heading to "Smog is a major contributor to depleting air quality around the world" and added a bar chart with the back-up data to show Pakistan's number 4 position in terms of the hazardous air quality.  

#### Color Scheme
I had initially kept a dusty light beige shade on both my moodboard and initial storyboard but with the user feedback and my own aesthetic assessment, I realized that if I changed the white background of Flourish to match this color, the graphs seemed to disappear and not mesh well with the theme. To match the dreary mood of the topic, I decided to change everything to a dark grey including the chart visuals. This had the desired impact and made everything look cleaner and easier to discern.  

#### "Change the color gradient on the pie chart to be more in line with the theme"
The Pie-chart depicting the causes of air pollution in Pakistan was the same color as the sketches I had made in Part 1 continued onto a Flourish representation in Part 2. At that point, I had not really thought about the color scheme matching for the entire story. I decided to change the colors to a gradient of 'red' as I had used the same for the world map to indicate a decrease in severity/proportion from dark red to a light pink. 

#### "Include how many cars per inhabitant are there in Pakistan and club buses and others together with the vehicles chart to show an improved visual"
In my initial visual, buses and others were merely a line that weren't comparable to the scale of cars and motor-bikes. As per an interviewees suggestion, I clubbed the numbers for buses and others together in one category. Additionally, I changed the colors to match the dusky yellow and red on-going theme for the charts included in the story and added a 'green' for the others category since that was a small portion of the whole. 

#### "Add a call to action section for how individuals can incorporate best practices in their life to alleviate the situation"
This was one of the most useful feedbacks I had received across the board from all the respondents I had interviewed. What can individuals themselves do in terms of best practices to increase their role in making a change? The storyboard in Part 2 only had some suggestions that policy-makers could push forward in their agendas while the audience was outlined as 'Pakistanis in urban centers'. After more research, I found an initiative started by the Prime Minister of Pakistan called the [Billion Tree Tsunami](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/pakistans-ten-billion-tree-tsunami); one that is also backed up by the United Nations to eradicate the effects of smog in the long-term. Furthermore, I found a [National Geographic Article](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/topics/resource-library-human-impacts-environment/?q=&page=1&per_page=25) that highlighted the human impacts of activities on the environment which I thought was useful for readers who wanted to educate themselves further. Finally, besides action, protection is also important. The swiss company IQAir has been a leading institution for both reporting and educating residents about unhealthy air metrices. They have established a [Clean Air Facility Program](https://www.iqair.com/us/commercial/clean-air-facility) and provided [Air Pollution Protection Guidelines](https://www.iqair.com/us/blog/air-quality/air-pollution-masks-what-works-what-doesn-t) for those interested in making a difference and protecting themselves. 

### Further Changes on Shorthand and Final Comments
In terms of the overall design, I did not want to have just blocks of text and chart throughout; so I used the media tools provided by Shorthand for a more sleak design and played around with the tools to change the positioning for a better read. Throughout the text, I used red color font to highlight words that I wanted the reader to focus on more or definitely register even while doing a quick scan of the website. In order to improve accessibility of the website for the reader, I also added a navigation tool on top for the important sections. Finally, a resources section was placed to correctly cite the work used.  

Overall, It was extremely empowering seeing the final product move from the initial sketches and outline. The target audience identified and the user feedback was critical in enabling the changes that were necessary for the final project to read its conclusion.
