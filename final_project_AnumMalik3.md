## Part 1
Since the onset of October, family and friends back home in Pakistan have been very vocal about the deteriorating air quality. As a Pakistani citizen myself, I have been aware of and lived through the smog crisis that has come to the forefront in the past decade. A heavy thick layer of smoke and fog envelops my city of Lahore, which is now the third most polluted city in the world. It stings the eyes, reduces visibility, makes breathing unbearable and poses significant health risks for future populations. I had been following the Air Quality Index at [IQ Air](https://www.iqair.com/us/pakistan) and decided to choose this as my topic to tell the story. Since the W.H.O has announced air pollution as a global threat, I started my research from there and gathered data from different sources for both global and Pakistan specific metrics to build a story that outlined the imminent threat, its devastating impact on life expectancy, the causes and what individuals and policy makers alike can do to alleviate the damage. I was confident that my data was sufficient enough to convert my sketches to graphs on Tlourish or Tableau.
