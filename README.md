# Malik-portfolio
Here's my portfolio that includes an amalgamation of visualisations and techniques learnt in Telling Stories with Data at Carnegie Mellon University!

# About Me
Hello! My name is Anum Malik (she/her) and I'm currently pursuing a Masters in Public Policy and Management, Data Analytics track at Carnegie Mellon University. Prior to starting graduate school, I worked in the food and beverage industry with a focus on business planning and strategy. 

# What I Hope to Learn
I want to learn how to effectively communicate ideas represented by data; and acquire the creative skills as well as the knowledge to use various tools to create compelling visuals. Post graduation, I aim to join an organization that allows me to be the primary link between the technical and business strategy teams; which will combine my professional experience and grad-school learnings. I thrive in environments that constantly encourage and foster new ideas and hope to become a leader that can influence organizational networks through impactful decision-making.
