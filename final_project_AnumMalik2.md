## Part 2

### Storyboard on Shorthand
At this step of the project, real data-sets were used to bring the sketches in part 1 to life using Flourish. The information was presented in a story-like format keeping the audience identified below in mind, while drawing inspiration from infographics, images and articles to create a foggy, dusty color scheme indicative of the thick effects of smog. When creating the storyboard, I kept the following questions in mind:

-	Is the content motivating for an audience to employ best practices in reducing air pollution?
-	Do I have all the relevant background research to tell this story?
-	Is there supporting material in the form of data, photos and infographics that I can use to help tell this story?
