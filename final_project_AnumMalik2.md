## Part 2

### Storyboard on Shorthand
At this step of the project, real data-sets were used to bring the sketches in part 1 to life using Flourish. The information was presented in a story-like format keeping the audience identified below in mind, while drawing inspiration from infographics, images and articles to create a foggy, dusty color scheme indicative of the thick visuals of smog. When creating the storyboard, I kept the following questions in mind:

-	Is the content motivating for an audience to employ best practices in reducing air pollution?
-	Do I have all the relevant background research to tell this story?
-	Is there supporting material in the form of data, photos and infographics that I can use to help tell this story?

### User Research
My **target audience** is the citizens of Pakistan focused in the urban centers of the country. These are the people that are most impacted by the hazardous air quality peaking during the winter months; from October to 


The questions that I intended to ask the interviewees were primarily focused on the logical flow and the persuasiveness of the storyline to inspire audiences to resort to raising awareness about air pollution and to be more involved in initiatives that could improve its currently hazardous status. I used the following **interview script** to get feedback:

-	Q.1: At first glance, what do you think this presentation is about?
-	Q.2: Does the storyline flow smoothly? 
-	Q.3: Was there anything that confused you?
-	Q.4: What, according to you, is the most informative section of the presentation?
-	Q.5: Are there element(s) that you think are missing or wish were included?
-	Q.6: What is your key feedback on the overall designing? Is there a clear theme that pops out?
-	Q.7: Is the content motivating for an audience to employ best practices in reducing air pollution?
-	Q.8: Do you have any other feedback for improvement?
