## Part 2

### Storyboard on Shorthand
At this step of the project, real data-sets were used to bring the sketches in part 1 to life using Flourish. The information was presented in a story-like format keeping the audience identified below in mind, while drawing inspiration from infographics, images and articles to create a foggy, dusty color scheme indicative of the thick visuals of smog. When creating the storyboard, I kept the following questions in mind:

-	Is the content motivating for an audience to employ best practices in reducing air pollution?
-	Do I have all the relevant background research to tell this story?
-	Is there supporting material in the form of data, photos and infographics that I can use to help tell this story?

### User Research
My **target audience** ,at large, is the citizens of Pakistan focused in the urban centers of the country. These are the people that are most impacted by the hazardous air quality peaking during the winter months; from October to February '......'

-

Agriculture Department needs to launch a systematic campaign for educating farmers on the harmful impacts of burning of crop residues and introduce alternative technologies for environmentally safe disposal of crop residue such as converting it into compost or mulch.
Green Industrial processes with resource efficiencies and emission reduction should be implemented in cement manufacturing plants, steel mills and thermal power plants.

Representative individuals to interview:



The questions that I intended to ask the interviewees were primarily focused on the logical flow and the persuasiveness of the storyline to inspire audiences to resort to raising awareness about air pollution and to be more involved in initiatives that could improve its currently hazardous status. I used the following **interview script** to get feedback:

-	Q.1: At first glance, what do you think this presentation is about?
-	Q.2: Does the storyline flow smoothly? 
-	Q.3: Was there anything that confused you?
-	Q.4: What, according to you, is the most informative section of the presentation?
-	Q.5: Are there element(s) that you think are missing or wish were included?
-	Q.6: What is your key feedback on the overall designing? Is there a clear theme that pops out?
-	Q.7: Is the content motivating for an audience to employ best practices in reducing air pollution?
-	Q.8: Do you have any other feedback for improvement?


### Interviews
**Response 1: 25 Year Old Female; teaching at a pre-school in Pakistan**

**Q.1: At first glance, what do you think this presentation is about?**

*A.1: It is about the increasing pollution in Pakistan and its health implication on the general population.* 

**Q.2: Does the storyline flow smoothly?**

*A.2: Yes, I think the issues and causes of smog/pollution are presented in a good flow.*

**Q.3: Was there anything that confused you?**

*A.3: You should explain that smog is caused by pollution and explain what smog is.*

**Q.4: What, according to you, is the most informative section of the presentation?**

*A.4: The overall use of infographics was helpful especially the pie chart highlighting the major factors contributing to increasing pollution in Pakistan was very informative.* 

**Q.5: Are there element(s) that you think are missing or wish were included?**

*A.5: I think in the introduction you should explain briefly what exactly smog is.*

**Q.6: What is your key feedback on the overall designing? Is there a clear theme that pops out?**

*A.6: Yes, the overall design is easy on the eye and infographics are easy to understand.*

**Q.7: Is the content motivating for an audience to employ best practices in reducing air pollution?**

*A.7: Yes, but you should also add actual pictures of polluted, smog heavy cities so that people can understand the scale of the issue.* 

**Q.8: Do you have any other feedback for improvement?**

*A.8: You should add which parts of Pakistan is most affected by smog and pollution. And at what time of the year is smog at its peak.*

**Response 2: 38 Year Old Male; working in the energy sector in Pakistan**

**Q.1: At first glance, what do you think this presentation is about?**

*A.1: Pollution around the world and how Pakistan ranks within these levels.*

**Q.2: Does the storyline flow smoothly?**

*A.2: It does give a good flow, but it can also be improved by shocking visual effects that make you go deeper in getting to know your research. I imagine this requires a lot of technical implementations that could not be easily accessible.*

**Q.3: Was there anything that confused you?**

*A.3: Yes! The big black backgrounds, especially the title. They made me lose. I think the could be improved with dark images related to the topic.*

**Q.4: What, according to you, is the most informative section of the presentation?**

*A.4: The number of vehicles. It’s a big takeaway and throws a lot of questions such as what are the urban planning policies, if these pollute in the cities or in rural areas, how many cars per inhabitant are there in Pakistan, and so on.*

**Q.5: Are there element(s) that you think are missing or wish were included?**

*A.5: I think it could be useful to have forecast scenarios of where the things are going. Pakistan is a country that still needs to grow its economy, and burning more fuels is essential for that. What will that future look like?*

**Q.6: What is your key feedback on the overall designing? Is there a clear theme that pops out?**

*A.6: I really don’t like the contrast between brown in the back and white in the graphs.* 

**Q.7: Is the content motivating for an audience to employ best practices in reducing air pollution?**

*A.7 It shows facts that are not necessarily related to people’s decisions. Particulate matter can be reduced with efficient fuels, the policy standards at the country level can change, and urban planning can also shift these trends. I think this is such a complicated development issue that it’s tough to ask Pakistan with 14 million cars to use the car less, when a country like the USA, with a similar population, has 276 million vehicles. However, if you purpose is to raise awareness, then this does a great job!*

**Q.8: Do you have any other feedback for improvement?**

*A.8 No, I think the flow is good. You might need to add a few more elements to make it more cohesive; otherwise job well done!*
