## Overview
Pakistan's air pollution almost doubled from 1998 to 2019. If this continues at the current level, residents are expected to have their lives reduced by 4.3 years compared to places that adhere to the air quality standards of the World Health Organization (W.H.O). 

## Outline
**Introduction**
- Depict an overview map that shows latest data across all countries on the world-map with metrics such as population, pollutant levels, gain in life expectancy 
- Pakistan is the fourth most polluted country in the world. 
- Particulate air pollution shortens lives globally, even more than smoking, alcohol and road injuries.
- The average life expectancy lost; globally, is 2.2 years for poor air quality regions below the W.H.O maximum standard of 10 micrograms per cubic meters of particulate matter 2.5 (PM 2.5).

**Focus on Pakistan**
- Air pollution shortens the average Pakistani's life expectancy by 4.3 years as per University of Chicago Air Quality Life Index.
- According to W.H.O Global Update of Risk assessment,  PM 2.5 estimates in Pakistan are 58 micrograms per cubic meter; which is almost 6 times the safe metric.
