## Assignment 3 and 4

### Step 1: Find a Data Visualization
The pandemic has been a critical topic of discussion since its devastating start in December 2019; and it has fueled a movement around active data collection on a global scale. Data tracking has transitioned from number of cases and deaths to now include vaccination trends across countries. With winter approaching and stringent enforcements of lockdowns continuing to be lifted, I became more curious to see any subsequent changes in the number of cases globally. Given the myriad of resources, dashboards and trackers, I was certain that I would find exactly what I was looking for but soon discovered that it was not as easy as I had assumed. Pretty much all the sources I tapped into, including but not restricted to the NY Times, CNN and WHO, had chosen to visualize total cases on a map of the world; followed by a huge table of countries that listed more COVID-19 statistics. This was a lot of information but nothing that I could absorb easily or possibly critique. After almost a three hour long search, I found an article on Bloomberg which focused solely on coronavirus cases around the world and zoomed in on a visual that intended to display how the outbreak spread in countries via number of cases from Feb 2020 to date. I chose this visual because it presented exactly the content I needed to see in an intuitive format; but in its attempt to make the data more succinct and visually compact, it took away crucial elements of informativity, made illogical comparisons between 'Asia' and 'Other' and was visually unappealing with the trendlines stacked together at the bottom of the chart. 'This could be an exciting re-design!', I thought to myself.

### Step 2: Critique the Data Visualization 

### Step 3: Wireframe a Solution

### Step 4: Test the Solution

### Step 5: Build Your Own Solution
