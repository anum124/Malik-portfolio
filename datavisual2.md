## Assignment 2
### Part 1
By comparing what is owed to what is produced, Debt-to-GDP ratio serves as a key indicator for a country's ability to pay back its debts. The graph below depicts the 'General Government Debt' of the OECD member countries with an emphasis on United States (U.S). In 2020, the U.S general government debt stood at 161% versus the OECD average of 80%. Though special circumstances may hold, a study by the World Bank concluded that if the Debt-to-GDP ratio of a country exceeds a threshold of 77% for an extended period, it tends to slow down the projected path of economic growth.

### Part 2 
Here we see a more detailed picture of the Debt-to-GDP ratio of 45 countries. The timeline of comparison is from 1995 to 2020; however, not all data is available for most countries for all years. After a detailed scan, one can pinpoint that Japan and Greece are the most indebted countries with ratios at 256.9% and 237.6% respectively in 2020, with italy and the U.S following suit at 183.9% and 161.4%. Estonia consistently maintains a low ratio from 1995 to 2020; however, in 2020 it rose slightly to 24.8% - still the lowest of all the countries in comparison.
