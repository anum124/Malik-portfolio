### Comparing the United States Debt-to-GDP Ratio with OECD Member Countries
By comparing what is owed to what is produced, Debt-to-GDP ratio serves as a key indicator for a country's ability to pay back its debts. The graph below depicts the 'General Government Debt' of the OECD member countries with an emphasis on United States (U.S). In 2020, the U.S general government debt stood at 161% versus the OECD average of 80%. Though special circumstances may hold, a study by the World Bank concluded that if the Debt-to-GDP ratio of a country exceeds a threshold of 77% for an extended period, it tends to slow down the projected path of economic growth.

### General Government Debt as a Percent of GDP (1995-2020)
Here we see a more detailed picture of the Debt-to-GDP ratio of 45 countries. The timeline of comparison is from 1995 to 2020; however, not all data is available for most countries for all years. After a detailed scan, one can pinpoint that Japan and Greece are the most indebted countries with ratios at 256.9% and 237.6% respectively in 2020, with italy and the U.S following suit at 183.9% and 161.4%. Estonia consistently maintains a low ratio from 1995 to 2020; however, in 2020 it rose slightly to 24.8% - still the lowest of all the countries in comparison.

### Focusing on Europe General Government Debt 2020
When choosing a visualization to display the Debt-to-GDP ratio, my initial idea was to depict the data on a worldmap by a varying gradient of color from green, to yellow to red which would showcase the degree of debt of each country for which the data was available for 2020. However, when displayed on the worldmap, the data was primarily concentrated in a small region; as 26 out of the 36 were categorized under Europe and it was hard to absorb it all visually. Therefore, I decided to map the  OECD general government debt existing data against the 'European Country and Other' demarcations identified by the World Bank data-set. This serves well for the intended purpose as the focus is on one geographical region  allowing a deeper focus in terms of both visualization and story-telling. The visualization below is easy to absorb, a quick glance shows us that Greece has the highest debt in in the region with the red shade along the scale and Italy is also on higher levels of debt lying in the orange range of the gradient. The gradient ranges were decided given the World Bank threshold of 77% and the color scheme was aligned with assumptions of the audience's preconceived ideas. Furthermore, a search bar is enabled to make the visual more interactive and allows the viewer to focus on specific countries. Labelling was not included on the map; instead custom pop-up boxes were enabled with the name of the country and the respective Debt-to-GDP ratio that can be viewed by hovering the mouse over the visual. 

In comparison with the bar chart, we see that while both data visuals are focused toward different audiences (the United States versus Europe), the information portrayed is similar in the sense that it depicts the Debt-to-GDP ratio for 2020. The map is actually a subset of the barchart. The grid of line charts is able to lay out 26 years of Debt-to-GDP data in a more cohesive manner; but it is visually challenging to pick out information or form a general opinion regarding the representation.
