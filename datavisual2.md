## Assignment 2
### Part 1
By comparing what is owed to what is produced, Debt-to-GDP ratio serves as a key indicator for a country's ability to pay back its debts. The graph below depicts the 'General Government Debt' of the OECD member countries with an emphasis on United States (U.S). In 2020, the U.S general government debt stood at 161% versus the OECD average of 80%. Though special circumstances may hold, a study by the World Bank concluded that if the Debt-to-GDP ratio of a country exceeds a threshold of 77% for an extended period, it tends to slow down the projected path of economic growth.
